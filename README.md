# Bank Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Poject Overview
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment bank customers based on key financial and behavioral features. By identifying five distinct customer profiles, it provides data-driven recommendations to help the bank refine its marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and foster long-term banking relationships across Germany, France, and Spain. 

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project was to demonstrate my analytical workflow and provide actionable insights through unsupervised learning, showcasing my ability to turn customer behavior data into strategic recommendations. 

## 👩🏻‍💻 Tools & Techniques
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* K-Means Clustering
* Feature Engineering & Standardization
* Elbow Method for Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
* Heatmaps for Cluster Insights

## 📊 Key Findings
* Cluster 0: Low balance, high product use (France & Spain) → Reward programs, financial guidance
* Cluster 1: High balance, low product use (France) → Investment offerings, premium savings
* Cluster 2: High balance, low product use (Germany) → Wealth services, custom plans
* Cluster 3: Low balance, moderate product use (France) → Financial literacy, entry credit tools
* Cluster 4: Low balance, low product use (Spain) → Retention campaigns, outreach incentives

## 🗺️ Geographic Insights
The customer data revealed meaningful behavioral differences across regions. German customers tended to prioritize savings and maintained higher account balances, reflecting a more conservative financial profile. Spanish customers showed greater product usage despite lower balances, pointing to more active spending behaviors. French customers fell somewhere in between, with a balanced blend of saving and product engagement. These regional patterns supported the development of targeted banking strategies, helping the bank tailor its services and outreach to local customer needs more effectively.

## 💡Recommendations
Each segment received custom strategies to enhance engagement, from loyalty-based incentives to targeted investment plans—directly supporting retention, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
